    "Segmentation is dividing and drouping the data that has similar significant characteristics. Data can be group several charasterictists.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most adopted segmentation is clustering. Clustering is unsupervised segmentation based on similarities.\n",

    "## What is a cluster ? \n",
    "\n",
    "A group of objects that are similar to other objects in the cluster, and dissimilar to data points in other clusters.\n",
    "__What is difference of clustering and classification ?__\n",
    "Classification is labeled dataset, clustering is unlabeled dataset.Classification is supervides learning. In clustering data is unlabeled and processing unsupervised. \n",

    "### Clustering Applications\n",
    "1. Retail/Marketing: \n",
    "    * Identify buying patterns of customers\n",
    "    * Recommending new books or movies to new customers\n",
    "2. Banking\n",
    "    * Fraud dedection in credit card usage\n",
    "    * Identifiying clusters of customers\n",
    "3. Insurance\n",
    "    * Fraud dedection in claims analysis\n",
    "    * Insurance risk of custemers\n",
    "4. Publication\n",
    "    * Auto-categorizing news based on their content\n",
    "    * Recommend≈üng similar news articles\n",
    "5. Medicine\n",
    "    * Characterizing patient behavior\n",

    "    * Produces trees of clusters\n",
    "    * E.g. Agglomerative, Divisive\n",
    "3. Density Based Clustering\n",
    "    * Produces arbitrary shaped clusters\n",

    "    \n",
    "## k-Means Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "* Partitioning Clustering\n",
    "* K-means divides the data into non-overlappng subsets without any cluster-internal structure\n",
    "* Examples within a cluster are very similar\n",
    "* Examples across different clusters are very different\n",
    "\n",
    "k-means should minimize the intra-cluster distances and maximize the inter-cluster distances\n",

    "### k-Means Clustering Steps\n",
    "1. Initialize k\n",
    "    * Initialize k=x centroids randomly\n",
    "2. Distance Calculation\n",

    "4. Compute the new centroids for each cluster\n",
    "5. Repeat until there are no more changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### k-Means Accuracy\n",
    "1. External Approach\n",
    "    * Compare the clusters with the ground truth, if it is available\n",
